# learn by parts

learn to approximate a 3D mesh with simple parts: cube, cylinder, cone, etc.

GOAL: create a hierarchical dataset of 3D meshes by parts, from simple to more and more complex.

## Requirements:

[PyTorch3d](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d)

## Running:

0- generate data:

`python3 create_dataset.py`

1- train model:

`python3 train.py`
